The plan of Litmine is the Amalgamation of spare energy from all of the plans. Lost and forgotten creatures merged with other lost ideas and souls, rejected creations from the gods, Defeated gods, and powerful creatures from other plans shattered and banished to this plan. Though these creatures, referred to as Chirmera's, aren't completely shut off. Powerful rites and rituals can bring these chimeras into other plans. With enough will and luck, a chimera may find a waste line that feeds the lost and rejected energy. Into the plan if the chimera is powerful enough, it can push into one of the plans from these waste lines.
